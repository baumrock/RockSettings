<img src=rocksettings.png class=blur>

Compared to other modules this module has the benefit that it creates a real page, which means:

- You can access it via $settings or settings() from everywhere
- You can upload assets like a logo or global images or files
- You can add/hide/change all the fields of the settings page as you like
- It adds a settings-icon to the main navbar of the backend
- It has a redirects feature to create short-links like yourdomain.com/example
